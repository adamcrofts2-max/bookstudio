# Status

## Version 1 — all eight phases complete

Book Studio now covers the full Development Plan loop: create a project, import a
manuscript, import illustrations, choose a theme, get an automatically generated
professional layout, make adjustments, and export a print-ready PDF.

### Phase 1 — Foundation
React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind v4 design tokens (colour/type/spacing/radius/
shadow/motion, see `docs/UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`), hand-built shadcn/ui-style primitives
(Radix + CVA), the three-column app shell, dark mode, Project Settings, and per-layer
Zustand stores persisted to `localStorage`.

### Phase 2 — Editor
- `src/parser/`: Markdown, TXT, HTML and DOCX (via `mammoth`, dynamically imported)
  importers, all producing the same `Chapter[]` shape. DOCX images are extracted
  straight into the asset library instead of staying inline as base64.
- `contentStore` (manuscript per project) and `assetStore` (image library, backed by
  IndexedDB via `src/store/assetDb.ts` — not `localStorage`, which caps out around
  5–10MB and can't hold "thousands of illustrations").
- Sidebar shows real chapter navigation and an asset grid with upload/delete.

### Phase 3 — Layout Engine
- `src/renderer/pageGeometry.ts` turns trim size + margins + bleed into real pixel
  page geometry.
- `src/renderer/HeightMeasurer.tsx` renders every block off-screen at the true page
  width/theme typography to get its real rendered height; `src/renderer/paginate.ts`
  greedily flows blocks into pages from those measurements: chapters always start on
  a recto (right-hand) page, headings never get stranded alone at a page bottom, and
  a table of contents is generated from the real resulting page numbers.
- Pagination is block-level (a paragraph never splits mid-way across a page — see
  "Known simplifications" below).

### Phase 4 — Themes
Five resolved presets in `src/theme/presets.ts` (Classic Novel, Premium Nature, Coffee
Table, Educational, Children's), each controlling page background/ink/accent colours,
heading/body fonts, justification, drop caps, and chapter-opener style. Switching
themes in Project Settings re-renders instantly — no re-import, per the non-negotiable
in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 5 — Typography
Hyphenation (`hyphens: auto` + `lang` attribute), ligatures, drop caps
(`.book-drop-cap::first-letter`), justified vs. ragged-right per theme, language-aware
line breaking.

### Phase 6 — Preview
Two-page spread / single-page toggle, zoom, and a page-thumbnail rail
(`src/renderer/ThumbnailRail.tsx`) with click-to-navigate, all in `Workspace`'s view
controls bar.

### Phase 7 — PDF Export
- Self-hosted Inter + Source Serif 4 (`public/fonts/*.woff2`, extracted from
  `@fontsource` — no external font CDN at runtime).
- `src/pdf/exportPdf.ts` renders the *exact* pagination currently on screen (published
  by `BookRenderer` into the ephemeral `exportStore`, guaranteeing WYSIWYG) to a real
  PDF via `pdf-lib` + `@pdf-lib/fontkit`: bleed, crop marks, embedded fonts, manual
  text-flow with bold inline runs, and images rasterised to PNG via canvas so any
  source format embeds cleanly.
- The Export PDF button saves via the File System Access API where available, falling
  back to a plain download.
- `pdf-lib`/`@pdf-lib/fontkit` and `mammoth` are dynamically imported so they only
  load when actually used — the initial JS bundle is ~484KB (was 2.1MB before
  splitting).

### Phase 8 — Optimisation
- `src/renderer/LazySpread.tsx` defers mounting a spread's real pages until it
  scrolls near the viewport (IntersectionObserver, 1200px margin), so books with
  hundreds/thousands of pages stay responsive on initial load and scroll.
- `useKeyboardShortcuts` (`[` `]` toggle panels, `v` spread/single, `+`/`-`/`0` zoom,
  `Esc` deselect) with a discoverable shortcuts reference dialog in the Toolbar.
- Radix primitives (used throughout `src/components/ui`) give focus management,
  keyboard navigation and ARIA semantics for dialogs/tabs/menus for free.

### Testing
`npm run test` (`scripts/smoke-test.ts`, jsdom) covers: all four manuscript parsers,
the paginator's invariants (no lost/duplicated/reordered blocks, chapters start recto,
TOC matches real page numbers), the inline-HTML-to-styled-runs conversion and greedy
text wrapper used by the PDF exporter, and a full end-to-end PDF export integration
test (pagination → font embedding → valid PDF bytes). All passing. `npm run build`
(typecheck + bundle) and `npm run lint` (oxlint) are clean.

## Known simplifications (documented, not hidden)
- **Pagination is block-level.** A paragraph always moves to the next page as a whole
  rather than splitting mid-paragraph. This avoids widows/orphans by construction but
  isn't how real DTP software flows text; line-level flow would be the natural next
  step if tighter page-fill is wanted.
- **PDF export is left-aligned even for "justified" themes.** True justification (even
  word spacing) is implemented on screen via CSS but not yet in the PDF text-wrapper.
- **PDF export doesn't apply per-image rotation** (screen preview does). Table cells
  don't wrap long text in the PDF (screen preview does, via CSS).
- **Italic emphasis (`<em>`) and hyperlink styling aren't distinguished in the
  exported PDF** — only bold is. On screen both render correctly.
- **Font embedding is unsubsetted** (full font files embedded, ~170KB overhead per
  export) after `scripts/smoke-test.ts`'s integration test caught a real
  `@pdf-lib/fontkit` subsetting crash (`RangeError` in `TTFSubset._addGlyph`) on these
  particular font files. Worth revisiting once that's understood upstream.
- **`LazySpread` is "lazy mount," not full virtualisation** — once a spread has been
  visible, it stays mounted rather than unmounting again when scrolled away. This
  keeps scrolling smooth but means a full read-through of an extremely long book will
  eventually have every page mounted. A true windowed list would unmount off-screen
  content too, at the cost of more complex scroll-position bookkeeping.
- **Tables/images/very large blocks can slightly overflow their page** if a single
  block is taller than a full page's content box — the paginator doesn't split
  individual blocks.
- A handful of unused Vite scaffold files and a stray partially-installed
  `node_modules/` may still be sitting in this folder from the very first session (this
  sandbox can't delete files here — see git history). Harmless; delete locally if you
  want a clean tree, then `npm install` again.
- `npm audit` reports two `react-router` advisories whose "fixed" version ranges
  contradict each other (upgrading *and* downgrading both get flagged) — looks like
  overlapping/synthetic advisory data rather than a real actionable CVE for this
  client-only SPA (no RSC/SSR in use). Worth a real second look before shipping.

## Deployment

Live at https://bookstudio-rose.vercel.app/ — Vercel project `bookstudio`, auto-deploys
from GitHub (`adamcrofts2-max/bookstudio`, `main`) on every push. `vercel.json` carries
the SPA rewrite (`/(.*) → /index.html`) required for React Router's client-side routes
to survive a hard reload/direct navigation.

### Post-deploy incident: blank page opening any project (fixed)
Opening any project crashed immediately with React error #185 ("Maximum update depth
exceeded"). Root cause: `Sidebar.tsx` selected assets from Zustand with
`s.byProject[project.id] ?? []`. Zustand v5 selectors run through React's
`useSyncExternalStore`, which decides whether to re-render by comparing the selector's
return value across calls — a fresh `[]` literal is a new reference every time, so the
comparison never settles and React re-renders forever. Fix: `assetStore.ts` now exports
a shared `EMPTY_ASSETS` constant, and the selector returns that instead of a new array.
**Any Zustand selector using `?? []` or `?? {}` (or otherwise constructing a literal in
the selector body) has the same bug — grep for `\?\? \[\]|\?\? \{\}` before adding new
selectors.**

A second, unrelated bug was found and fixed in the same pass: hard-navigating to a
nested route (e.g. `/project/:id`) 404'd on Vercel. `vercel.json` had only ever been
created in a scratch directory during earlier debugging and was never actually
committed to this repo, so the deployed app never had the SPA rewrite. It's committed
now.

Both fixes verified live (not just build-clean) via a real browser: opening the "test"
project renders the editor shell with no console errors, and a hard reload on
`/project/:id` loads the app directly instead of Vercel's 404 page.

## Recommended next task
Everything in the Development Plan's "Definition of Version 1 Complete" now works
end-to-end. From here, good next steps in priority order: (1) line-level text flow so
paragraphs can split across pages like a real book, (2) justified text and image
rotation in the PDF exporter, (3) proper glyph subsetting once the fontkit bug is
understood, (4) an AI layout/critique pass per the PRD's "Future" AI features, (5) EPUB/
Kindle export.
